# How to Learn

Session by Patrick Baumgartner

We covered Techniques and Strategies to learn effectively.

In Patricks Funnel, we discussed on how we destill the topics to the ones which are important
but also interesting to us. Additionally we covered formats and techniques techniques for each
phase of the learning journey.

TLDR; OpenSpace/BarCamp/Unconferences are the format which is supporting all phases of the learning journey!
