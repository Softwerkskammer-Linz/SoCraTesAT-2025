Coding Fun: Only Functions
--------------------------

To start the day, I proposed a Coding Fun session: Only Functions, nothing else.
And we will use Java to make our life extra miserable. But let's see what is possible.
This is not practical but it made the participants think outside their usual ways.

* Code we created: in this folder

Thank you for coming to my session.

If you want to go further, writing the whole of FizzBuzz with Nothing but functions, check out
my [repo](https://github.com/codecop/FizzBuzz-with-Nothing-Kata) which contains starter code
for TypeScript and some milestones (on branches).
