# Branch Deployment

Abl showed his service for branch deployment he built for Boudicca.events: https://github.com/boudicca-events/branch-deployer

There were discussions about how to extend this to Kubernetes, how to deal with persistent data (we did not come up with a great solution) and about the usefulness of branch deployments in general.
For example, it is most useful for all UI-related changes, since you can see and show them better. For backend related changes there is not much benefit.
