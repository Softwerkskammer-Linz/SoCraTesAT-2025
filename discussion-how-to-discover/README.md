# How to Discover (Discussion - I want to learn)
by Emanuel Kienmeier

No presentation, but some notes / keywords of the main take-aways of the discussion.

* “Scenario Casting”
* The organization needs to be mature enough for “empowered teams”. If managers overrule any other voices, the concept of empowered teams will never work.
* “Handbook for new Employeess” (Valve?)
* Developers join client interviews remotely (as sometimes they want to avoid any close touch points with clients) which allows them to immediately give feedback or submit questions that should be asked in the interview.
* Client interviews need to be institutionalized so that product managers are in constant exchange with clients (e.g. at Atlassian every Product Manager is required to do at least 3 client interviews per week).
* Stay in the problem space to really understand the problem, don’t switch to the solution space “too soon”.
* Concrete features which are asked directly by clients (“we want to have a 360 degree feedback feature”) could be re-framed to give it a slightly different aspect or distinguishing property.
