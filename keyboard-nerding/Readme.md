# Nerding on Keyboards

- Highlighting ergonomical issues with normal keyboards
    - Layout based on typewriters
    - Forces you to a un ergonomic shoulder position
    - A lot of pinky usage for modifiers and special characters


- Intro into ergo split boards and the benifits
    - open shoulders
    - little wrist movement based on [Miryoku](https://github.com/manna-harbour/miryoku/tree/master/docs/reference) (really nice explanation of the goal of this layout)
    - easy to use special symbols due to layering instead of movement
    - easy to use modifier keys due to Home-Row-Mods
