# EU Alternatives

Session about alternatives for hardware, software, services, and similar things from European sources.

## Overview

### Preamble

Doing anything "self hosted" is always an alternative.
This here focuses on the cases I can not / want not to host myself.

### Motivations

* get away from "big tech"
* get away from US (foreign) dependency
* support (more) local providers
* security / privacy / GDPR
* deliberate payment instead of "being the product"

### Learnings

* Not using "big tech", some loss of performance or convenience is expected

### Approach

* Find a main service you use (want to avoid), and start with replacing this. Then iterate.
* When thinking about a domain, separate "mail provider" from "domain provider". Allows you to mix and match services
* On smartphones: Have different profiles. One for "public services" (that require standard/common OS) and a "typical service".

#### Used Approaches

1. get a Google free phone
2. get a Google free email (also separate domain from mailbox)
3. get a Google free drive

Another approach

1. use European domain provider
2. use a secure browser and search engine
3. get rid of Google
