## Are You The Invisible Executive
  
  Maybe you’re no stranger to high-stakes boardrooms, critical decisions, and intense 12-hour workdays. You’ve led multi-million-dollar projects and your LinkedIn profile reads like a corporate playbook.
  
  But here’s what stings:
  Despite all that… you still leave most rooms unremembered.
  
  Whether it’s a networking event, internal team meeting, or stakeholder Zoom call—you blend in. You’re articulate. You’re competent. But your presence doesn’t stick.
  
  You want to be known not just for what you do—but **who you are** and **what value you bring**.
  
  That’s where this simple, science-backed tool comes in:

## The 1-Minute Sticky Introduction

### Why Traditional Intros Fail (And What to Do Instead)
  
  Most executives default to credentials:
  
  > “Hi, I’m James. I’m VP of Strategy at a fintech startup. I lead cross-functional teams to drive enterprise innovation…”
  
  Technically accurate—but emotionally forgettable.
  
  * Tells what you do, not why it matters
  * Makes you blend into a sea of high-achievers
  * Triggers no emotion, story, or mental image
  
  To be remembered, you don’t need to **impress**.
  You need to **resonate**.
  
  A 60-second self-introduction that’s clear, story-driven, and values-centered does 3 things:
  
  1. Positions you as high-trust, high-authority
  2. Establishes emotional connection in seconds
  3. Plants a memorable story that sticks after you leave the room
  
  And best of all, you can use it everywhere—from pitch meetings to dinner parties.

## The Formula: 1-Minute Sticky Introduction
  
  Used by executive coaches, Navy SEALs, TED speakers, and entrepreneurs. Four parts:
  
  1. **Name + Role**
  2. **The Deeper Why**
  3. **Relatable Story or Origin Moment**
  4. **What You Help People Do / Your Unique Edge**

### Let’s Break It Down

#### 1. Name + Role (5 seconds)
  
  Skip jargon. Be human.
  
  > “I’m James, I lead growth strategy at a fintech company.”

#### 2. The Deeper Why (10–15 seconds)
  
  What drives you beyond the title?
  
  > “I’m obsessed with helping companies scale without losing what made them great—culture, trust, and innovation.”

#### 3. Relatable Origin Moment (20–30 seconds)
  
  A 1-sentence story about how you got here.
  
  > “I started my career in consulting and saw so many brilliant teams fail—not because they lacked strategy, but because they couldn’t communicate or align fast enough. That sent me down the rabbit hole of strategic operations and team psychology.”

#### 4. What You Help People Do (10–15 seconds)
  
  Your unique edge:
  
  > “Today, I help leadership teams scale with clarity—so they move fast, stay aligned, and never burn out their best talent.”

### Example of a Sticky 60-Second Intro
  
  > “Hi, I’m James. I lead growth strategy at a fintech company. I’m obsessed with helping organizations scale without losing what made them great—culture, trust, and innovation.
  > I started in consulting and watched too many smart teams collapse under the weight of unclear goals and constant firefighting. That led me into strategic ops and behavioral performance.
  > Today, I help leadership teams scale fast—but sustainably—so they hit big goals without burning out their best talent.”

## Why This One Tool Changes the Game
  
  When you start using your 1-minute intro:
  
  * People remember you in crowded rooms
  * You’re asked to speak on panels
  * Your internal reputation improves
  * You mentor others and advance faster
  
  You didn’t work more—you became **visible**, **valuable**, and **vocal**.

## Where to Use This Introduction
  
  * Leadership team meetings
  * Investor calls
  * Off-sites or all-hands
  * Conferences
  * Podcasts or media
  * LinkedIn bio/About section
  * Mentorship or coaching
  * Even social events like dinners or dates

## Advanced Power Move: Anchor Your Identity
  
  Your intro is more than a tool—it’s a mirror.
  
  Say it often. Live it.
  Use it to filter your time, energy, and decisions.
  
  Stop chasing 100 urgent tasks.
  Start designing your week around **strategic identity**.

## Don’t Just Work Hard — Be Known for Something That Matters
  
  Your calendar won’t promote you.
  Your inbox won’t build your reputation.
  Your resume won’t open doors like a values-driven identity.
  
  In leadership, story is not a luxury.
  It’s a **leverage point**.

## Your Next Step: Write Your Sticky Introduction
  
  Use this template:
  
  > “Hi, I’m \[Name], I \[title or what you do]. I’m passionate about \[deeper why].
  > I got into this because \[1-sentence origin story].
  > Now, I help \[who you help] \[achieve what result].”

### Pro Tip: Rehearse & Refine
  
  * Record yourself
  * Test in low-stakes settings
  * Adjust based on reactions
  * Refine quarterly

  
  **You don’t need to shout to stand out.**
  Just say something that sticks.
